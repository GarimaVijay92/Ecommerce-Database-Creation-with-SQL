# SQL Database Design & Insights for E-commerce Data

## Project Overview
This project involves designing a database and extracting insights using SQL. The objective was to build a structured database to store and manage data efficiently and enable data-driven decision-making.

## Use Cases:
E-commerce Dataset – Analyzes customer transactions, product sales, and operational performance.

Project Workflow:
1. Understanding Business Requirements
Gathered key business needs, including data storage, reporting, and defined key metrics for e-commerce performance analysis, such as sales trends, top 10 products, revenue insights etc.

2. Database Design (ERD & Logical Model)
Developed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out entities, attributes, and relationships.

3. Converted the ERD into a logical database schema to ensure efficiency and normalization.

5. SQL Insights & Analysis

Wrote SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights, including:

1. Top 10 products by total sales value
